## Inside Our First Program and Beyond

**Note:** Nazu

This note explores the concepts introduced in our first C program and delves deeper into computer fundamentals.

**Conditional Statements:**

The code snippet demonstrates conditional statements using `if` and `else` keywords. The indented lines within the `if` block only execute if the condition is true. This allows for programmatic decision-making.

**Our First C Program:**

This program simply prints "hello, world" to the screen. While seemingly simple, it showcases the core elements of a program:

- **#include <stdio.h>**: Includes the standard input/output library for functions like `printf`.
- **int main(void)**: Defines the main function, the program's entry point.
- **printf("hello, world\n");**: Prints the specified string to the console.

**From Readable Code to Binary:**

Computers understand instructions in the language of 0s and 1s (binary) due to their electrical nature. Compilers translate human-readable code into machine code (binary) for execution.

**Binary Basics:**

- Binary uses 0s and 1s to represent information.
- Counting in binary follows the same logic as decimal, but with "carrying the 1" after each position (e.g., 10 in binary is 2).
- Common binary representations: 0 (0), 1 (1), 2 (10), 3 (11), 4 (100).

**Bits and Bytes:**

- A bit is the smallest unit of information in a computer, holding a single value (0 or 1).
- A byte is a collection of 8 bits (2^8 = 256 possible values), commonly used to represent characters or small numbers.
- We often hear terms like megabyte (MB), gigabyte (GB), etc., which refer to larger collections of bytes (e.g., 1 MB = 1,048,576 bytes).

**ASCII and Character Representation:**

- ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a standard that assigns binary codes to letters, numbers, and symbols. This allows computers to display text.

**Example: Converting "HI" to Binary:**

The note provides an example of converting the letters "HI" to their corresponding binary codes using the ASCII chart (image not included).

**From Numbers to Binary:**

The note explains how numbers in decimal are converted to binary through place value and powers of 2.

**Binary Exercises:**

- Try converting the following decimal numbers to binary:
    - 5 (101)
    - 10 (1010)
    - 16 (10000)
- To convert larger numbers, break them down by place value and add the corresponding binary equivalents (e.g., 23 = 16 + 4 + 3 = 10001).

**Scratch: A Visual Programming Tool:**

Scratch allows creating simple programs using drag-and-drop blocks. It's a great introduction to programming concepts like:

- Statements: Instructions given to the computer (e.g., "say").
- Boolean Expressions: Evaluations resulting in true or false (e.g., "touching mouse-pointer?").
- Loops: Repeating a block of code (e.g., meow indefinitely).
- Conditions: Controlling program flow based on certain criteria (e.g., meow only if touched).
- Variables: Storing and manipulating data within a program (e.g., slices_of_bread_left).
- Arrays: Collections of related data (e.g., storing different types of fruit).

**Looking Ahead:**

The note briefly mentions threads, hinting at the concept of running multiple programs concurrently.

**Key Takeaways:**

- This note provides a foundation for understanding binary, basic programming constructs, and Scratch as a learning tool.
- It lays the groundwork for exploring more advanced computer science concepts.

**Additional Resources:**

You can find online resources and tutorials to practice binary conversion and explore Scratch in more detail.

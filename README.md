# This is CS50
Welcome to the CS50 Fair! CS50 is a first course in Computer Science for concentrators and non-concentrators alike. More than just teach you how to program, this course teaches you how to think more carefully and how to solve problems more effectively. As such, its lessons are applicable well beyond the boundaries of computer science itself. That the course does teach you how to program, though, is perhaps its most empowering return.

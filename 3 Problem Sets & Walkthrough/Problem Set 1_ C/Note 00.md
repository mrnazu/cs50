# Chart
![alt text](image.png)
- Chart width is max 80 characters
- width of bard based on proportion, not total sighthings
    - 3 M spotting F is not 3 # on the chart
    - round DOWN when calc total number of #

**Examples:**
- total sightings = 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 10
    - M spotting F = 3/10 = 30%
    - F spotting M = 4/10 = 40%
    - F spotting F = 1/10 = 10%
    - M spotting M = 2/10 = 20%

- Max width is 80 char
    - M spotting F = 0.3 * 80 = 24
    - F spotting M = 0.4 * 80 = 32
    - F spotting F = 0.1 * 80 = 8
    - M spotting M = 0.2 * 80 = 16
